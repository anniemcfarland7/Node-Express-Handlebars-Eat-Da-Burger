# Node Express Handlebars - Eat Da Burger

## Description 

Eat Da Burger is a burger logger app that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).
Users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat, then when "Add" is clicked, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The user also has the option to delete added burgers in case they change their mind.
To begin, simply use "node server.js" in the command line.
